## Expectations
This project is designed to give you experience web scraping, but assumed that you have some basic familiarity with at least Requests and BeautifulSoup. Selenium is not used extensively enough to need familiarity, but you will need to install it.  

## Caution  
While I will try to keep these kind of projects updated, please keep in mind that websites can change at any time. Your production models will require constant attention and maintenance to ensure they are delivering the data and results that you expect.
